        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration/Track Athlete</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current second year attending UC Riverside. I am a student athlete on the track team here and love competing and bringing the best out of myself. Each day I strive to become better in all aspects of life. On the track, I will put struggle through the painful workouts that my coach devises for me that could only be described as malice. I do the same in my classes as the desire to grow overlaps with each other. If I ever feel like quitting in either activity, I ask myself if I am putting forth the same effort in class as I did on the track earlier and vice versa. I have run track since 2015 and have not lost my love at all. It has most likely grown stronger as I keep seeing myself becoming better and getting closer to the goals that I set out for myself many years ago. I have also been a part of a positive coaching alliance program at my alma mater high school for the last few years encouraging young athletes to become better and more positive leaders for their respective sports teams. I have done some assistant coaching as well teaching drills and workouts to younger athletes.<br><br>

        I find myself fascinated by two things. Track and Marketing. I am a "stats guy." People come to me quite often asking my opinion on different athletes and also advice about big decisions. I am a very logical thinker and can drop potential biases about certain athletes or people I know. People see this in me and come for my unfiltered, impartial opinion that I can give when others are scared to. My grandpa shares a common interest in the stock market and business marketing as well. He has taught me much about these two topics and strengthened my love for it. I have helped him choose stocks in the past such as the GTCH stock a few months ago which shot up about $13 a few weeks after we bought thousands of shares of it. I hope to be able to continue investing and also learning about other potential areas of revenue. I have begun working under a neighbor of mine who has his own real estate agency as well. I have also started an artpage for my sister's artwork marketing her abilities. She is very shy and introverted so she would rather not be involved in any of the selling or marketing operations and just focus on her artwork. I love managing this for her as she is able to continue her passion of art and I can practice marketing different kinds of art to people. <br><br>
I am a Middle-Distance runner, but most people that know me would describe me as a hybrid sprinter. This is because I am very aerobically gifted being able to maintain 40-50 mile weeks without any wear and tear. However, I would be the fastest sprinter on many college teams. I excel greatly in the half-mile distance where all of my strengths come together. My Personal Records are as follows: 200m PR: 22.14 400m PR 48.10 800m PR: 1:52.16 1500m PR 4:05.
